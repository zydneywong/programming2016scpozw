2016.09.26 - Great work Zydney! If you really didn't look at the solution
(although we did go over it in class) then your work was spot on. One thing
to watch out for is creating vectors in loops. For example if I create on vector
to fill then I create something of size say 5 ([*, *, *, *, *]) whereas if I
create a new vector each time and increase its size I create objects of size 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 ([*], [*, *], [*, *, *], [*,*,*,*], [*,*,*,*,*]). That's a lot more
things to create and the size of the difference grows exponentially in the number
of loops! Overall, your participation is great, but remember that submitting
anything is sufficient to get a grade, so do submit even blank documents!

and don't worry about the plotting, it is too difficult to work with at this
point.

2016.10.25 - HW6 - Hi Zydney, thanks for your note. I understand things are
             busy and can't imagine how tough it is doing two master's. If
             you're understanding of all the subjects is as good as your
             understanding of consumer theory, I'm sure you are doing great,
             but do take some breaks! I hope you have a nice vacation.
